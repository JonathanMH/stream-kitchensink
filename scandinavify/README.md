# scandinavify

A project about silly characters.

## Usage

Enter any text and have it turned from

`Home, sweet home` into `Høme, sweet høme` (Danish variant).

Updates:

* words like `snack` should become `snäck` (Swedish variant)
* words like `bard` should become `bård` (Danish variant)

## CLI Commands
